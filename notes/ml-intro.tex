  What are the central problems in machine learning?

  Problems in machine learning are similar to problems in science.
  Scientists must plan experiments intelligently and collect data.
  The must be able to use the data to verify a different hypothesis.
  More generally, they must be able to make decisions under
  uncertainty (Without uncertainty, there would be no need to gather more data).
  Similar problems appear in more mundane tasks, like learning to drive a car.

  For that reason, science is a very natural application area for
  machine learning.  We can model the effects of climate change and
  how to mitigate it; discover structure in social networks; map
  the existence of dark matter in the universe by intelligently
  shifting through weak gravitational lens data, and not only study
  the mechanisms of protein folding, but discover methods to
  synthesize new drugs.

  We must be careful, however. In many cases we need to be able to
  interpret what our model tells us. We also must make sure that
  the any results we obtain are reproducible. This is something
  that we shall emphasize in this course.

  While machine learning models in science are typically carefully
  handcrafted by scientists and experts in machine learning and
  statistics, this is not typically the case in everyday
  applications. Nevertheless, well-known or home-grown machine
  learning models are being deployed across the application
  spectrum. This involve home assistants that try and get you want,
  web advertising, which tries to find new things for you to want,
  lending, which tries to optimally lend you money so that you buy
  what you didn't need before. We also have autonomous vehicles,
  which take you were you want to go, and ridesharing services,
  which do the same thing, but use humans instead. Finally, there
  are many applications in public policy, such as crime prevention,
  justice, and disease control which use machine learning.  In all
  those cases, we have to worry about a great many things that are
  outside the scope of the machine learning problems itself. These
  are (a) privacy: you don't want your data used in ways that you have
  not consented to (b) fairness: you don't want minorities to be
  disadvantaged and (c) safety: you don't want your car to crash.

\subsection{Data analysis,  learning and planning}

\only<article>{
  To make the above more concrete, let's have a look at a number of problems in machine learning. These involve learning from and analysing data, including inferring decision rules, and constructing complex plans using the evidence gleaned from the data. Machine learning problems are commonly separated in three different types: supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. Typical supervised learning problems include classification and regression, while unsupervised problems include compression, clustering and topic modelling. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, is concerned with artificially intelligent agents more generally, with examples including game playing and adaptive control. Their main differences are two. Firstly, the \emph{type} of feedback we have about learning performance. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, whether or not the problem involves \emph{active data collection}. In this course, we will try and take a global view of these problems in the context of decision theory.

\only<article>{
  You can use machine learning just to analyse, or find structure in
  the data. This is generally called unsupervised learning. One such
  example is topic modelling, where you let the algorithm find topics
  from a corpus of text.  These days machines are used to learn from
  in many applications.  These include speech recognition, facial
  authentication, weather prediction, etc. In general, in these
  problems we are given a \emph{labelled} dataset with, say, example
  images from each class. Unfortunately this does not scale very
  well, because obtaining labels is expensive.

  This is partially how science works, because what we need to do
  is to find a general rule of nature from data. Starting from some
  hypothesis and some data, we reach a conclusion. However, many
  times we may need to actively experiment to obtain more data,
  perhaps because we found that our model is wrong.

\end{frame}


\only<article>{
  So, what happens when we make a mistake? Can we somehow recognise
  it? Humans and other animals can actually learn from their
  mistakes. Consider the proverbial rat in the maze. At some
  intervals, the experimenter places some cheese in there, and the
  rat must do a series of actions to obtain it, such as navigating
  the maze and pulling some levers. It doesn't know how to get to
  the cheese easily, but it slowly learns the layout of the maze
  through observation, and in the end, through trial-and-error it
  is able to get to the cheese very efficiently.

  We can formalise this as a reinforcement learning problem, where
  the rat takes a series of actions; at each step it also obtains a
  reward, let's say equal to 0 when it has no cheese, and 1 when it
  eats cheese. Then we can declare that the rat's utility is the sum
  of all rewards over time, i.e. the total amount of cheese it can
  eat before it dies. The rat needs to explore the environment in order to be able to
  get to the cheese. 

  An example in robotics is trying to teach a
  robot to flip pancakes. One easy thing we can try is to show the robot
  how to do it, and then let it just copy the demonstrated
  movement. However, this doesn't work! The robot needs to explore
  variations of the movement, until it manages to successfully flip
  pancakes. Again, we can formulate this as a reinforcement learning
  problem, with a reward that is high whenever the pancake's position is
  flipped, and on the pan; and low everywhere else. Then the robot can
  learn to perform this behaviour through trial and error. It's
  important to note that in this example, merely demonstration is not
  enough. Neither is reinforcement learning enough. The same thing is
  true for the recent success of AlphaGo in beating a master human:
  apart from planning, they used both demonstration data and self-play,
  so that it could learn through trial and error.  }

  I suppose the first question is whether machines can plan
  ahead. Indeed, even for large problems, such as Go, machines can
  now perform at least as well as top-rated humans. How is this
  achieved?

\only<article>{
  The basic construction is the planning tree. This is an enumeration
  of all possible future events. If a complete enumeration is
  impossible, a partial tree is constructed. However this requires
  evaluating non-terminal game positions. In the old times, this was
  done with heuristics, but now this is data-driven, both through the
  use of expert databases, and through self-play and reinforcement
  learning.

  An example that typifies trial and error learning are bandit
  problems. Imagine that you are in a Casino and you wish to
  maximise the amount of money you make during the night. There are
  a lot of machines to play. If you knew which one was the best,
  then you'd just play it all night long. However, you must also
  spend time trying out different machines, in order to get an
  estimate of how much money each one gives out. The trade off
  between trying out different machines and playing the one you
  currently think is best is called the exploration-exploitation
  trade-off and it appears in many problems of experiment design for
  science.

  Simplifying the problem a bit, consider that you have a large
  number of drug candidates for cancer and you wish to discover
  those that are active against it. The ideas is that you select
  some of them, then screen them, to sort them into active and
  inactive. However, there are too many drugs to screen, so the
  process is interactive. At each cycle, we select some drugs to
  screen, classify them, and then use this information to select
  more drugs to screen. This cycle, consequently has two parts:
  1. Selecting some drugs given our current knowledge.
  2. Updating our knowledge given new evidence.

  between these variables. So what do we mean by "hypothesis" in this case?

  It is quite easy to draw the wrong conclusions from applying

  fashionable to perform fMRI studies in humans to see whether some
  neurons have a particular functional role. There were even
  articles saying that "we found the neurons encoding for Angelina
  Jolie". So some scientists tried to replicate those results. They
  took a dead salmon, and put it an fMRI scanner. They checked its
  brain activity when it was shown images of happy or sad
  people. Perhaps surprisingly, they found an area of the brain that
  was correlated with the pictures - so it seemed, as though the
  dead salmon could distinguish photos of happy people from sad
  ones. However, this was all due to a misapplication of
  statistics. In this course, we will try and teach you to avoid
  such mistakes.
